From NHS.UK frontend v10.0.0 onwards, Internet Explorer 11 and other older browsers will no longer run NHS.UK frontend JavaScript. Our CSS is still compatible with Internet Explorer 11.

Stable versions of browsers refer to all stable releases of Chrome, Firefox and Edge released in the last 6 months and the last 4 releases of Safari.

For 'compliant' browsers we aim to provide the same baseline experience.

For 'necessary' browsers we aim to support optional enhancements as much as possible. However, we might sometimes need to adjust the component's behaviour, while still allowing the users to complete their task. This might include:

- falling back to the no-JavaScript experience
- disabling parts of the enhancement
- doing a simpler alternative

For 'limited' browsers we do not download or attempt to parse NHS.UK frontendâ€™s JavaScript. We will not regularly test in these browsers. We will not fix bugs affecting these browsers.

# Assistive technology support

We test NHS.UK frontend with the following assistive technology:

| Software                                            | Software version | Browser                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| JAWS (desktop screen reader)                        | 2019 or later    | Chrome or Edge (latest version)          |
| NVDA (desktop screen reader)                        | Latest           | Chrome, Firefox or Edge (latest version) |
| VoiceOver on iOS (mobile screen reader)             | Latest           | Safari (latest version                   |
| TalkBack (mobile screen reader)                     | Latest           | Chrome (latest version)                  |
| Windows Magnifier or Apple Zoom (screen magnifiers) | Latest           | Any                                      |

This table is based on the [2016 survey of assistive technologies used to access GOV.UK](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/01/results-of-the-2016-gov-uk-assistive-technology-survey/) and the more recent [WebAIM screen reader survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/).

We also test that our components:

- are accessible using a keyboard only
- function correctly when using [high contrast mode in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13862/windows-use-high-contrast-mode)
- function correctly when using ZoomText (screen magnifier)
